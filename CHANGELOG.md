## Semantic Versioning

This modlist uses a modified semantic versioning to identify which competition it is targeted at, where given a version number SEASON.CONTEST.PATCH, increment the:

1. SEASON version when the contest season changes. **Contest rules will change.**
2. CONTEST version when the contest changes. **Contest rules may change between contests.**
3. PATCH version when hotfixes and/or updates are released mid-contest.

## 3.20.4

**Released:** `27 Feb 2023`

### Info <!-- omit in toc -->

This is for the SimSettlements Season 3 - February 2023 Contest.

You **MUST** use the supplied `CleanSaveVault.fos` or `New_Game_V111_Exit__Yagisan.fos` saves to create your entry.

This release now includes a tool to collect all relevant logs to help with technical support with this list. After exiting Fallout 4 (or right after it crashes), select **Yagisan's Log Grabber** from the menu bar where you see **F4SE**. Select run. It will do its thing, and provide you with a zip file that you can upload for support.

This is a special release - **[We are using the Fairline Hills Settlement by Pra.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35869)**
