To install and enable addons that use optional Creation Club content, click on the jigsaw puzzle icon in the menu bar. Then select `Creation Organizer`. Then restart the SS2CPC Helper. You should do this after you download new Creation Club content, to get changes and updates.

**Please note that Creation Club content is currently forbidden in the Sim Settlements City Plan Contest.** Plots that use Creation Club content are permitted.

**Important Information for Nexus Collections Users**

It has come to my attention that some popular Nexus collections, most notably A StoryWealth are including loose mods including loose scripts. The SS2CPC Helper will ignore properly packaged mods. **These are not properly packaged mods.** Fallout 4 **will** load these loose files into the SS2CPC Helper, and potentially break your game. This is not a bug in the SS2CPC Helper. However there is a workaround. You have 2 options. First you can use the *Purge* function in Vortex before you start building. Second you can create a new profile in Vortex with no active mods and switch to that.
