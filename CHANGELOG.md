## Semantic Versioning

This modlist uses a modified semantic versioning to identify which competition it is targeted at, where given a version number SEASON.CONTEST.PATCH, increment the:

1. SEASON version when the contest season changes. **Contest rules will change.**
2. CONTEST version when the contest changes. **Contest rules may change between contests.**
3. PATCH version when hotfixes and/or updates are released mid-contest.

**Now requires Windows 10 1809+ or Windows 11.**

For Season 4 April 2024 of the City Plan Contest.

Build an Outpost in Kingsport Lighthouse, Outpost Zimonja or Coastal Cottage.

To install and enable addons that use optional Creation Club content, click on the jigsaw puzzle icon in the menu bar. Then select `Creation Organizer`. Then restart the SS2CPC Helper. You should do this after you download new Creation Club content, to get changes and updates.

**Please note that Creation Club content is currently forbidden in the Sim Settlements City Plan Contest.** Plots that use Creation Club content are permitted.

**Important Information for Nexus Collections Users**

It has come to my attention that some popular Nexus collections, most notably A StoryWealth are including loose mods including loose scripts. The SS2CPC Helper will ignore properly packaged mods. **These are not properly packaged mods.** Fallout 4 **will** load these loose files into the SS2CPC Helper, and potentially break your game. This is not a bug in the SS2CPC Helper. However there is a workaround. You have 2 options. First you can use the *Purge* function in Vortex before you start building. Second you can create a new profile in Vortex with no active mods and switch to that.
